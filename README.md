# 2022_CoffeeHouseGames
A series of educational math games within a framework that includes a dashboard, audio manager, game manager & a scorekeeper.

- A Game Manager keeps track of various game states (pause, game over, TimeScale).
- An Audio Manager loads and plays audio clips when called upon. For simplicity, all games use the same audio effects until time may be invested in 'beefing it up.'.
- A Scorekeeper keeps track of the score and attempts in each game, displays them in the Dashboard and calculates an overall score and overall attempts.
- A Background Audio Manager loads specific music/audio for each game and yet allows the player to play the next track on a loop of 8 audio(includes a null track).

The games themselves are as follows:
- MakingChange- a coffeehouse-based edu-tainment based on an order placed, amount tendered, change given
- SpaceArmiesComparison- Use logic symbols(<=>) to declare one army larger than the other or that they are equal
- BurgerJointFractions- choose between fractions/percents challenge. When given one you must supply the other.
- SpeedTrap- an algebra challenge as a number problem. Can you catch that zippy speedster?

This project relies upon several panels which house the corresponding game objects, scripts and data
Aside from the above mentioned game panels we have the following additional panels:
- Intro- the splash screen for the project
- Game Index- a horizontal layout of the different, clickable game images
- Credits- Showcase and promote the contributions of the creators of contributed works
- Dashboard- A visual display of all of the game results in one place to give the player a means of evaluating their performance and improving their results
- Pause- Every game needs a pause screen. This one includes three buttons for Dashboard, Credits and a third option

This project all began with the desire to create a change-giving math trainer to help people develop the necessary skills to perform a basic function at a high level.
Because math is a constant companion I run calculations all day long, as a result I decided to add more varied and possibly more complex methods of challenging others using math as a base.

This led to the creation of the next three games.

Enjoy at your own risk!
